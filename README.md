start up repository aka me learning how to create one

Hello World Wide Web and people using it, 

I'm the user ari-e-l. I'm a novice at programming and usually tired. I run off of encouragement and spite.
I'm interested in learning how to code and creating (whether that's code, robots, or buildings depends on my mood).

That's about it for my introduction. 

See ya.
